## What does this plugin do?
Updates the dashboard's *At a Glance* widget to show the total word count of all the published posts in your WordPress website (and average word count per post). Also shows the age of the website (time since the oldest post). Uses the default dashboard icons and styling, so it's completely seamless. Just more information for you. Plugin includes these languages: English, Spanish and Portuguese.
