Updates the Dashboard's At a Glance widget to show the total word count of all the published posts and age of this Wordpress website.

== Description ==
Updates the Dashboard's At a Glance widget to show the total word count of all the published posts in this Wordpress website (and average word count per post). Also shows the age of the website (time since the oldest post). Uses the default dashboard icons and styling, so it's completely seamless. Just more information for you.

== Screenshots ==
1. You can see the total word count of the published posts in the site and the average words per post. Also the current human readable age of the website and the date of the oldest post. Now it's also shown the total words in comments, and you can hover the mouse above that to know how many words you've written in the comments.
